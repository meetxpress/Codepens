                be tested Objective To measure stability of newly created build. To evaluate and validate the rationality and the originality of core functionality of the build. Subset of Acceptance Testing Regression Testing When to conduct which test?
                Conducted when new software builds are available Conducted after completion of regression testing activities/rounds. Documentation Scripting work is needed No scripting work is needed. Performed By whom? Developer or testers Only testers.
                Example Log in, compose and send mail through Gmail. Auto-acknowledgement sent through Gmail. Level of testing Description Unit Testing Checks if software component, unit, or a block of code are fulfilling functionalities or not.  Programmer’s
                task Integration Testing Checks the data flow from one module to other modules. Approaches:  Big bang o All modules are to be tested together as a system. o Rarely used for large applications/programs.  Top down Approach o Main menus
                are to be tested first then sub menus. o “Stubs” (is called by module under test) are used to simulate the behaviour of lower level modules.  Bottom Up Approach o Sub menus are to be tested first then main menus. o “Drivers” (calls the
                module to be tested) are used to simulate the behaviour of upper level modules. System Testing Evaluates both functional and non-functional needs for the testing. Acceptance Testing Checks the requirements of a specification or contract
                met as per its delivery. Smt. Chandaben Mohanbhai Patel Institute of Computer Applications Master of Computer Applications (MCA) Semester - II CA852 Software Quality Assurance MCA Page 3 Difference between Regression testing vs Re-Testing
                Comparison Regression Testing Re-Testing Performed for Passed test cases Failed test cases Checks for Unexpected side effects Original fault has corrected. Defect verification included. No Yes Known as Generic testing Planned testing Use
                of automation is possible is not possible. Carried out Parallel with retesting. Should performed before regression testing. Difference between Load testing vs Stress Testing Comparison Load Testing Stress Testing Objective a system can
                handle the expected number of concurrent users with minimal to acceptable performance degradation to find the breaking point of the system and see where it crashes Difference between Load testing vs Scalability Testing Comparison Load
                Testing Scalability Testing Objective focusses on testing an application under heavy loads, to determine at what point the system response time fails Focusses on performance of your websites, software, hardware, and application when changes
                are done in the size or volume of the system to meet a growing need. Smt. Chandaben Mohanbhai Patel Institute of Computer Applications Master of Computer Applications (MCA) Semester - II CA852 Software Quality Assurance MCA Page 4 Other
                Types of Non-functional Testing Recovery Testing  Verifies the system's ability to recover from points of failure like software/hardware crashes, network failures etc.  It involves reverting to a point where the integrity of the system
                was known and then reprocessing transactions up to the point of failure. Restart the system while a browser has a definite number of sessions open and check whether the browser is able to recover all of them or not Security  The goal
                of security testing is to identify the threats in the system and measure its potential vulnerabilities, so the system does not stop functioning or is exploited. - Compatibility  to ensure compatibility of the system/application/website
                built with various other objects such as other web browsers, hardware platforms, users (in case if it’s very specific type of requirement, such as a user who speaks and can read only a particular language), operating systems etc.  helps
                find out how well a system performs in a particular environment that includes hardware, network, operating system and other software etc. -
